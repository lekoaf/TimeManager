TimeManager
===========

With working as a programming consultant comes sending in reports 
of the hours that you work.

I could have just configured an Excel sheet to calculate that for
me, but why go the easy route when you can make a webapp?

This is actually the third iteration of this app.

First Iteration
===============
Frontend: HTML, CSS / Bootstrap, JavaScript / jQuery.

Backend: A RESTful api that me and a colleague made a
couple of months ago in PHP. PHP model and MySql database.

Second Iteration
================
Frontend: HTML, CSS / Bootstrap, JavaScript / jQuery.

Third Iteration
===============
Frontend: Angular JS with Bootstrap.

Backend: NodeJS with Express and MongoDB.

Third iteration is still in development.
